# 🏠 Online Home Services Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Online Home Services Platform** is a web-based application that connects customers with professional home service providers through a single digital system. The project aims to simplify the process of booking and managing home services such as plumbing, electrical work, cleaning, appliance repair, and general maintenance.

This project is developed using **HTML, Bootstrap (CSS), JavaScript, and PHP**, combining a responsive frontend with server-side functionality. **Bootstrap** is used to design a modern and mobile-friendly user interface, **JavaScript** adds interactivity and form validation, and **PHP** handles backend logic including service requests and admin operations.
